# Regular Expressions - Evaluation Functions

A regular expression, regex or regexp (sometimes called a rational expression) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation.

Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. These patterns are used with the `exec` and `test` methods of `RegExp`, and with the `match`, `matchAll`, `replace`, `search`, and `split` methods of `String`. This chapter describes JavaScript regular expressions.
