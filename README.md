# Regular Expressions - Evaluation Functions

A regular expression, regex or regexp (sometimes called a rational expression) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation.

Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. These patterns are used with the `exec` and `test` methods of `RegExp`, and with the `match`, `matchAll`, `replace`, `search`, and `split` methods of `String`. This chapter describes JavaScript regular expressions.

`exec` 
The `exec()` method executes a search for a match in a specified string. Returns a result array, or `null`.

`test`
The `test()` method executes a search for a match between a regular expression and a specified string. Returns `true` or `false`.

# Regular Expressions - Metacharacter Symbols
Metacharacters are the building blocks of regular expressions. Characters in RegEx are understood to be either a metacharacter with a special meaning or a regular character with a literal meaning.

# Regular Expressions - Character Sets - Quantifiers
Quantifiers specify how many instances of a character, group, or character class must be present in the input for a match to be found. ... Ordinarily, quantifiers are greedy; they cause the regular expression engine to match as many occurrences of particular patterns as possible.
